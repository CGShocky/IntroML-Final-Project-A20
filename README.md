Code is still messy. To use, there should be a folder/file called ./Data/MTG/scryfall-default-cards.json (you can find it here https://scryfall.com/docs/api/bulk-data) and a folder ./Data/Sentiment Analysis/ which should have the IMDB sentiment analysis dataset(you can find it here : https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).

After data run in order in ./Data_acquisition: Data_acquisition.py => pricing_data_acquisition.py => Dataset_merging.py

You can then parametrize ./Algorithms/Classifier.py with the functions at the end and run to get predictions.

BERT is incoming.
